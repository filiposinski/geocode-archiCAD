# GEOCODE-ArchiCAD 0.1 pre-alpha


## HELLO THERE! 

## TL;DR
The aim of this project is converting the file with geocode into the file with extra data about the color of each point.

## WHY
During the work with an ArchiCAD we discovered that it is impossible to use a geocode file which include only 3 data (latitude, longitude and elevation) to generate a point cloud. We need a file with 3 more data which describing a color of an each point.  

We decided to make the app which will solve this problem and allow you to import the geocode file, add 3 extra positions and to export a new file after conversion. Then you will be able do use it in an ArchiCAD to generate a point cloud.


## HOW IT WORKS
