## GEOCODE-ArchiCAD 0.1


# HELLO THERE! 

# TL;DR
The aim of this project is converting the file with geocode into the file with extra data about the color of each point.

# WHY
During the work with the ArchiCAD we discovered that it is impossible to use the geocode file which include only 3 data - latitude, longitude and elevation. We need the file with 3 more data which describing the color of the each point made out of the geocode.
